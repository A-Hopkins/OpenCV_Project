# Setup 
*** This is a living document to log how to set up various components of the required software for the project ***

## Windows
To install OpenCV follow the steps below
1) Install cmake from [here](https://cmake.org/download/)
2) Install openCV from [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases)
    * Pick the source code and unzip in chosen location
3) Load cmake-gui, and the navigate to the source code for source code location, then create a folder for
the build binaries to be created. (** note I had problems with my mingw/cmake install and my antivirus, if you get errors 
that seem like you don't have g++ in your path variables it might be due to your antivirus like I was)
4) In cmake-gui press the configure button and then generate after picking what you want
5) Navigate to your build folder that you assigned cmake-gui to output, and run the mingw32-make command in command prompt
6) After the mingw32-make command is done running (it may take awhile),run mingw32-make install
7) Add user environment variable '~\Opencv_lib\bin\install' and then path variable '~\Opencv_lib\bin\install' ** for example
8) For clion add in the CMakeLists.txt
    ```
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3)
    project(OpenCV_Project)

    set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
    include_directories( ${OpenCV_INCLUDE_DIRS} )

    FIND_PACKAGE( OpenCV REQUIRED core highgui imgproc)
    set(OpenCV_FOUND TRUE)

    set(SOURCE_FILES main.cpp)
    add_executable(OpenCV_Project ${SOURCE_FILES})
    target_link_libraries( OpenCV_Project ${OpenCV_LIBS} )
    ```
