# OpenCV Project
This is a living document to chronicle the development of an OpenCV project to use computer vision to track user 
hand gestures and perform computer actions based on those gestures.

## The Idea
The idea will be to see a full fledged application that runs in the background of an operating system and uses the web 
camera of the computer to track the user and looks for 'trigger' hand gestures to scroll a web page or switch tabs for 
example.

This project is starting with very limited knowledge of OpenCV and a working knowledge of C++.
